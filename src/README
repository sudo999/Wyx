Wyx was originally a project I was working on many years ago in Inform 7, a "human readable" language for creating interactive fiction, long before I knew any proper programming languages or techniques. It failed, predictably, and Inform became (even more) obsolete with the passing years. In Spring of 2014, I decided to revisit the project, this time building my own framework from scratch in Java.
 This framework is intended to be versatile and extensible, and when the core classes are finished I may add additional, optional packages to the repository.
 
Initial Features:
 Concrete classes:
  Items
    -can be held by the user
    -can be in a location
    -each has a list of functions
  Locations
    -can be connected to other locations
  Directions
    -(such as North, South, etc - these are intentionally left uninstantiated)
 Abstract classes:
  Functions
    -an exec(Object o) method wrapped in an object so that it can be passed. Each has a class of objects it can be applied to
    ItemUses
      -a Function with an associated item which allows the execution of that function.
      -for example, the ItemUse function for unlocking doors would be associated with Key items and apply to Door items (note: keys and doors have not been implemented yet)
 Static classes:
  User
    -attributes: an inventory, a health value, a maximum health value, a damage multiplier, and a location
    
Upcoming features:
  A user interface:
    commands
    a "help" function
    descriptions for use in an "examine" command (possibly plaintext files?)
  The capability to save and reload the game
